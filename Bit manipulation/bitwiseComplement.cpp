//              Complement of Base 10 Integer
//The complement of an integer is the integer you get when you flip all the 0's to 1's and all the 1's to 0's in its binary representation.

//For example, The integer 5 is "101" in binary and its complement is "010" which is the integer 2.
//Given an integer n, return its complement.
